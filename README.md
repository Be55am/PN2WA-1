The check of the systems has a considerable interest to insure their reliability and their safety 
especially since they are often submitted to numerous constraints, and some of them have an
impact on dangerous processes and on human lives. To increase the degree of confidence in
these systems, several formal methods are have been developed.
In this report we consider the synchronized Petri nets (as formal framework of systems
modeling) and their conversion into weighted automata. This transformation allows first of
all to benefit from existing verification methods in the field of the weighted automata. It
allows secondly to determine the sequence of events which guides the passage of a current
state of the synchronized Petri net towards one desired final state.
This work presents in particular the design and the implementation of a tool which allows to
generate for every synchronized Petri net, the corresponding weighted automata. The used
approach is based on an improved calculation method of the coverability graph for
synchronized Petri nets with single unbounded place.
